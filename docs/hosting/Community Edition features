- [Environments](/source-control-environments/)
- [Version control using Git](/source-control-environments/)
- [External storage for binary data](/hosting/scaling/external-storage/)
- [Log streaming](log-streaming/) ([Logging](/hosting/logging-monitoring/logging/) is included, however)
- [Multi-main mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/#multi-main-setup) ([Queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) is included, however)
- [External secrets](/external-secrets/)
- SSO ([SAML](/hosting/securing/set-up-sso/), [LDAP](/user-management/ldap/))
- [Projects](/user-management/rbac/projects/)
